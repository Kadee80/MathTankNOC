Class: Nature of Code 
Built With: Processing 2.0, Toxiclibs Verlet Physics

Underwater math creatures compete for springy dominance in this virtual ecosystem.

What happens when you take some indecisive coral, a few pernicious sine wave predators, and a big heard of springy shramp
and drop them into one luxurious math tank? These self conflicted springy creatures will either settle into a sustainable food web, or wipe themselves out with their overconsumption.

Math Tank, built with Processing and ToxicLibs combines simple physics, probability, steering behaviors, and genetic algorithms to create a series of creatures with distinctive personalities, wants, and needs. A user add to the system and then watch it run. Adding too many, or too few creatures to any of the niches will undoubtedly affect the outcomes. 

Peaceful coexistence or a survivor series? You decide.

Instructions:

• Click in tank to create a feesh
• Click on sea floor to plant more coral
• Drag the mouse to create a gaggle of shramps

Shramp tend to stay together, those who break off from the pack due to hunger are vulnerable to the sine feesh. Shramp go after coral when hungry and reproduce if fed enough. Feesh seek the vulnerable shramp when hungry. They grow and shrink in length based on hunger and satiation. The more they eat, the more effective they become at hunting.
